## Project ðŸ’»  

 Simple app with a endless Flatlist and single call to API endpoint.

## Instructions ðŸ“š  

At this point, I imagine that you already have your React Native environment installed and configured if you don't have it follow the instructions (https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

First, clone the project to your computer then access the project directory. On the project directory type "yarn" or "npm i" (according to the package manager you prefer to use)

I'll imagine you don't have this app installed on your device yet and you use yarn (if you use npm change "yarn" for "npx" on the lines bellow

for iOS: `yarn react-native run-ios`

for android: `yarn react-native run-android`

if you already have it stalled 

`yarn start`
