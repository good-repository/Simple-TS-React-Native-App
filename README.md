## Project ðŸ’»  

 Simple app with a endless Flatlist and call to an endpoint.

## Instructions ðŸ“š  

At this point, I imagine that you already have your React Native environment installed and configured if you don't have it follow the instructions (https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

First, clone the project to your computer then access the project directory. On the project directory type `yarn` or `npm i` (according to the package manager you prefer to use)

I'll imagine you don't have this app installed on your device yet

for iOS: `yarn ios` or `npx react-native run-ios`

for android: `yarn android` or `npx react-native run-android`

if you already have it installed : `yarn start` or `npx run start`
